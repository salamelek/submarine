SUBMARINE NOTES

the prefix "0x" before a number, means it's a hexadecimal number
0x00 = 0
0x0a = 10
0xff = 256


WORKFLOW

1) [PC] The python program sends the user input via serial to the arduino
2) [AR] The transmitter arduino gets the user input from serial, and it sends it via RF
3) [AR] The receiver gets the data and does stuff


communication:
    There are 10 variables:
        1x fullness
        1x main motor
        1x bow thrusters*
        2x servos
        1x depth
        1x angle
        1x grabber
        1x lights

    Every variable has 1 byte (0-255)
    the info string is of length 30 chars

    *only 1 bow thrusters because they are symmetrical anyway


ktv_dict = {
	"w": (1, 1),
	"a": (2, 1),
	"s": (1, 0),
	"d": (2, 0)
}

The key is the key pressed
the tuple has the index of the motor/servo and if it should increment or decrement (1 and 0 respectively)
